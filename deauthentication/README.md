# Deauthentication

* ### What is it about ?
As shown in the *.pcapng file, multiple deauthentications are carried out by device X. However, this is actually a fake deauthentication performed by device Z who copied the MAC address of device X, resulting in an interruption of the Wi-Fi connection for device X.
